### Inspiration

I have always loved electronics, physics and engineering and i saw this as an opportunity to see what actually making a dedicated project was like. Next year I will enter a project by ESA called CanSat (i have to build a satellite the size of a can of soda) and i plan on using my multitool to control and get data from the CanSat. I also plan on exploring the firmware and costumize the multitool every once in a while to do something different with it.

### Challenges

My biggest challenge was creating the 3x3 matrix and replacing the top left key with the rotatary encoder switch, but the whole project was very fun to do and the slack community was very helpful (shoutout). Believe it or not, i spent over 12 hours on this project because it was my first and i had to learn how to do things. I think it turned out pretty nice for a first project honestly and i love that now i know all this stuff about electronics! IT'S JUST THE BEGGINING I AM COMING BACK FOR MORE!!

### Extras

I used KiCad to build the PCB, Fusion 360 for the case and QMK as the firmware. In the future, I want to add more components and I WILL ADD MORE COMPONENTS but for now that's it lol.
Honestly i want to add something more here but I don't know what to add..
I'm from Portugal lol

### Specifications

BOM: 
- 8x Cherry MX Switches
- 4x SK6812 MINI-E Leds
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 8x Blank DSA Keycaps
- 9x through-hole 1N4148 Diodes
- 1x EC11 Rotary encoder
- 1x 0.91 inch OLED display 

Others:
- QMK Firmware
- Top.step
- Bottom.step

### Note:

It doesn't look like it in the case pictures, but it does have space for the PCB and the holes in between keys are for the diodes and not put too much pressure on them.
