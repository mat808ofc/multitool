### Inspiration

I have always loved electronics, physics and engineering and i saw this as an opportunity to start showing myself to the world and see what actually making a dedicated complex (for me) project was like. Next year I will enter a project by ESA called CanSat (i have to build a satellite the size of a can of soda) and i plan on using my multitool to control and get data from the CanSat. I also plan on exploring the firmware and costumize the multitool every once in a while to do something different with it.

### Challenges

My biggest challenge was creating the 3x3 matrix and replacing the top left key with the rotatary encoder switch, but the whole project was very fun to do and the slack community was very helpful (shoutout). Believe it or not, i spent over 12 hours on this project because it was my first and i had to learn how to do things. I think it turned out pretty nice for a first project honestly and i love that now i know all this stuff about electronics!
